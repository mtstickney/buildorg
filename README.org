* The Service
  This application provides a basic service to compile org-mode
  documents to pdf. The app accepts file uploads from a provided form,
  and sends back a zip file of compiled pdfs and build logs, or a 500
  "Internal Server Error" error if the build  process fails entirely.

  By default, the services is accessible at the =/build/= url. GET
  requests to =/build/= will return the upload form, while POST requests can
  be used to upload files without using the form.

* Example
  : curl --form org_file=@myfile.org --form buildit=OK -o myfile.zip http://docs.foo.com/build/

* Usage
  Simply run the =docbuild.py= script:
  : python docbuild.py
