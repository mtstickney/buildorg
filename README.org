* The Service
  This application provides an org-mode compilation service. The
  application provides two urls for uploading org-mode documents for
  compilation.

  The =build/= url allows a client to POST one or more org-mode files
  and receive a zip file containing the converted pdfs files and
  associated logs.

* Example
  : curl -F file1=@myfile.org -o myfile.zip docs.foo.com/build/
