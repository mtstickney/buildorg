* The Service
  This application provides an service to compile org-mode documents to pdf. 
  The app accepts file uploads from a provided form, and sends back a zip file 
  of compiled pdfs and build logs, or a "Bad Request" error if the build 
  process fails entirely.

  The =/build/= url allows access to the build service directly, without going 
  through the web form

* Example
  : curl -F file1=@myfile.org -o myfile.zip docs.foo.com/build/
